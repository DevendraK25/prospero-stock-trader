NodeJS Paper Stock Trader, utilizing Market Data API

This project was originally intended for Prospero One, however with our current capacity
we were not able to deliver a full fledged paper trader, so users can clone this repository
and setup the proper API keys in the .env as well as a MongoDB database. The API will be 
functional then and users can interact with a paper trader via CRUD operations.
